    Introduction

cyield is a simple implementation of the python `yield' keyword in C using the
win32 api, it uses Threads which give some overhead, but due to the simplicity
of programming with so-called Generators this might be worth considering.
For more information on the `yield' keyword, see the official python docs.

    Explanation of the implementation

So, assuming the readers knows the yield keyword by now, we have to store the
state whenever a value is `returned', I could not think of a simpler method then
using another thread, because the Operating System keeps track of the stack and
registers, so all you have to do is make sure the thread executes on the right
data on the right time.

This implementation is based on an existing implementation in Objective-C using
so-called Blocks, this article can be found here:

    Examples

For two simple, but possibly realistic, examples, see main.cpp
